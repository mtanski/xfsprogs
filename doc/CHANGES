[cvs]
	- Fix for xfs_repair mangling i8count for dir2_sf directories
	- Minor mkfs.xfs man page update for blocksize limits on Linux

xfsprogs-2.0.6 (30 May 2002)
	- Fix error returns from log recovery (affects xfs_repair).
	- Fix the way mkfs.xfs round downs the device when the last 
	  AG is smaller than the minimum AG size.
	- Fix bug in xfs_repair da_write() routine, which affects
	  filesystems where the data blocksize != naming blocksize
	  (see xfs_info output).
	- Fix a use-after-free bug in xfs_repair code for checking
	  version 1 btree-format directories.
	- Add checks of the ACL permissions field into xfs_repair.

xfsprogs-2.0.5 (02 May 2002)
	- Size AGs so that they do not always start on the same 
	  part of a striped disk
	- Fix an off-by-one error on rounding down an AG that is
	  too small to be an AG
	- Don't auto-grow the log to be larger than an AG
	- Change the error philosophy for -d su=,sw= away from forcing 
	  the XFS stripe size to match the volume manager stripe size
	  and instead accept, with a warning, the stripe unit & width
	  supplied on the commandline.
	- Update xfs_growfs man page
	- Don't build libxlog.a with DEBUG enabled
	- xfs_db fixes from ASANO Masahiro at NEC

xfsprogs-2.0.4 (17 April 2002)
	- Minor update sync'ing with kernel changes (less endian
	  swabbing in libxfs code)

xfsprogs-2.0.3 (13 April 2002)
	- Important build system update, was causing libxfs to be
	  built incorrectly, which can cause xfs_repair to fail by
	  tripping asserts in additional libxfs debug code.

xfsprogs-2.0.2 (04 April 2002)
	- Bumped version of libhandle to libhandle.so.1.0.1
	  This changes open_by_handle() and friends so that 
	  O_LARGEFILE is added to the open flags.
	  This allows xfsdump to dump files greater than
	  2^31-1 bytes instead of not dumping the large
	  files and giving warning messages.

xfsprogs-2.0.1 (12 March 2002)
	- Fall back to BLKGETSIZE if BLKGETSIZE64 fails
	- Sync user/kernel headers and shared code

xfsprogs-2.0.0 (26 February 2002)
	- Major release to coincide with switch to new extended
	  attributes system call interfaces
	- bumped version of libhandle, added new symbols to use
	  the reworked extended attributes handle ioctl interface
	- xfs_repair in no-modify mode opens the filesystem device
	  read-only now (fix from Chris Pascoe)
	- sync up with recent (minor) changes to shared kernel code
	- switch to using the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl in libxfs, instead
	  of the (previously busted) BLKGETSIZE ioctl

xfsprogs-1.3.19 (15 February 2002)
	- fix xfs_repair option parsing for external logs
	- add xfs_repair option parsing for realtime device
	- fix xfs_repair version (-V) option - should not
	  require an argument
	- add -V option to usage string
	- document verbose (-v) and -r options in manpage

xfsprogs-1.3.18 (17 January 2002)
	- fix mkfs.xfs buglet in overwriting signatures when run
	  on a regular file

xfsprogs-1.3.17 (14 January 2002)
	- mkfs.xfs overwrites pre-existing filesystem, swap, or md
	  driver signatures.
	- xfs_repair fix to prevent double insertion into the
	  uncertain_inode AVL trees ("avl_insert: duplicate range")
	- xfs_repair fix if the log is corrupted and we can't find
	  the head, don't exit - just proceed on with zeroing it
	- use snprintf instead of sprintf throughout

xfsprogs-1.3.16 (17 December 2001)
	- added text dump type to xfs_db (mkp)
	- removed use of a temporary file in xfs_db when processing
	  commands on the command line - allows xfs_check to be run
	  on read-only root filesystems

	- reenable the use of the BLKBSZSET ioctl, its baaack
	- sync recent XFS kernel source changes back into libxfs

	- fix minor debian package version numbering issue
	- add documentation for xfs_db(8) label/uuid commands
	- automatic inode sizing code in mkfs.xfs has been removed
	  (restricting inodes to 32 bits) - Steve's recent kernel
	  changes mean this is no longer an issue
	- fix bug in mkfs.xfs size cross-check for realtime device

xfsprogs-1.3.13 (25 October 2001)
	- fix bug in mkfs for 1Tbyte + filesystems
	- sync with recent kernel changes - this does not affect
	  userspace (libxfs), all affected code is removed by cpp.

xfsprogs-1.3.12 (17 October 2001)
	- implement the -f (file) option to xfs_logprint
	- rework the xlog code into libxlog for code sharing
	- xfs_repair now detects a dirty log and, without -L, will
	  no longer blindly zero it (which prevents any recovery)

	- tidy up some (benign) compiler warnings from libxfs
	- fixed 64-bit pointer alignment issues in xfs_check

	  lvdisplay program to get volume geometry (mkp@mkp.net)
	- fix bug in LVM driver wrapper where it would not have been
	  used at all, ever (since 1.3.0), due to idiot programmer
	  error (*blush*) -- also thanks to mkp for the bug fix

xfsprogs-1.3.7 (10 September 2001)
	- enable preallocation in xfs_mkfile [missed during port?]
	- fix xfs_db core dump when reporting freespace
	- allow libuuid to be linked dynamically if desired (based
	  on a patch from Colin Walters <walters@verbum.org>, helps
	  the folk working on the Debian installer for XFS)

	  and some related header files
